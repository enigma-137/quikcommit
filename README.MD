To make your `README.md` more beginner-friendly and provide clear instructions for both users who want to **install and use the package** (as a dependency) and those who want to **clone and run the project**, here's an updated version. This includes explanations for installation, usage, and setup for users coming from npm tutorials.

- Can use Google Generative AI to provide intelligent commit messages.
- Easy to use with just one command.
- Integrates seamlessly with your Git workflow.

## Installation

### Install as a Dependency

If you'd like to use **QuikCommit** as a package in your own projects, follow these steps:

1. Install QuikCommit using npm (make sure you have Node.js installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g quikcommit
   ```

2. Ensure your Git repository is initialized:
   
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for using Google's Generative AI API (optional):
   - Create a `.env` file in your project’s root folder and add your API key:
     ```bash
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
     ```

4. Now you can run `quikcommit` in your Git repository to auto-generate commit messages!

### Clone the Repository

Alternatively, if you want to clone the QuikCommit project and run it directly, you can do so:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quikcommit.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd quikcommit
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root folder and adding your Google API key (optional):

   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
   ```

5. Now, you can run the script directly:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

## Usage

### Usage as an npm dependency

After installing QuikCommit globally, you can use it in any Git project with just one command:

```bash
quikcommit
```

This command will:

1. Check for changes using `git diff`.
2. Automatically generate a commit message based on the detected changes.
3. Use Google's Generative AI to generate a smarter commit message (if set up with an API key).
4. Automatically stage and commit your changes using the generated commit message.

### CLI Commands

- **Run QuikCommit**: To generate a commit message and commit the changes:
  
  ```bash
  quikcommit
  ```

- **Check if you're in a Git repository**: If the tool encounters the error `fatal: not a git repository`, ensure you are in a Git-initialized directory by running:

  ```bash
  git init
  ```

---

## Environment Variables

To use QuikCommit with Google Generative AI, you'll need to set up your environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following variable:

   ```bash
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
   ```

3. The `GEMINI_API_KEY` is required to access Google's Generative AI API.

4. Without the API key, the tool will generate a default, non-AI commit message.
